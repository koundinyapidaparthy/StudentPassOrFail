First You need to install npm package (npm init -y)
Then need to install express(npm i express)
    here express is a framework of nodejs

In public Folder :
    
    I created index.html,Sass folder inside i created index.sass file 
    so Here Frontend part is completed 

In Src Folder:

    I created index.js File 
    I downloaded somore packages (hbs,node-fetch)
    hbs is templating language 
    node-fetch package is used to fetch the Api 

    And for PORT i used process.env.PORT so that heroku dynamically host the page

In templates Folder :

    * i copied index.html file from public folder and in templates folder i created Another folder views
        inside Views i Pasted the index.html code and name the file as index.hbs file
    * for meta tags i used partials (these are also come form handlebars hbs)

this is all about frontend and backend 

And i uploaded the files into git hub and heroku with help of ssh(secure Shell)
    
    *ssh is used to create a secure channel between a local and remote computer.

    for this i installed git and heroku 
    And i also installed npm heroku -g(globally) package in my pc.

    and after setting all things it worked.
